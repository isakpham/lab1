# lab1

 As I have never programmed in C++ before this lab was a good learning experience for me.  
The tasks was challenging enough to enable some problem solving whilst not making them impossible to solve. 

 
The most frustrating thing during this task was the secure warning  I got when using scanf. 
Informing us beforehand about this warning couldâ€™ve saved me an hour or two but that is my only complaint. 
 
 Most of my problems stemmed from me having a cold during the first two lectures missing some important information. 
 But since there are so many good guides online I made it work, though it probably took more time than it needed to 
 as I spent roughly 20 hours on the assignment.
